## 📝 Description

`Basalt-auth` is a library designed to enhance the security of your applications by adopting a simplified yet effective approach to authentication and token management.

Drawing inspiration from [JSON Web Tokens (JWT)](https://jwt.io/), `Basalt-auth` stands out by offering an alternative solution that embraces the fundamental strengths of JWTs while enriching the user experience with expanded capabilities.

One of the main advantages of `Basalt-auth` lies in its key management: instead of using a global secret key, it generates a unique key pair for each token, thereby increasing the security of the individual session.

Only the public key and the token are retained, ensuring that interactions remain secure and private.
